# AdvancedMessageBoxes01

The project is sample code originally published in [How to add features to standard message boxes in ATL and WTL](http://alax.info/blog/127) blog post in 2006.

The code received some attention on StackOverflow in [Win32 custom message box](https://stackoverflow.com/a/7848018/868014) question, and I so I re-published the project and also updated it to be in good standing for Visual Studio 2019.

You might need to download and install [Windows Template Library](https://wtl.sourceforge.io/).
